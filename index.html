<h1> Hasher </h1>
<i>If you need a hash, we've got your back.</i>
<h2> What's Hasher? </h2>
Hasher is an <b>open-source</b> and <b>free to use</b> software. The aim of Hasher is to provide an easy way to make random hashes, that doesn't imply the download of some crypto-mining program that logs hashes and nonces and more nonsense. 
Hasher is designed to just give you hashes - as easy as that.

<h2> What can Hasher do? </h2>
If I were to explain you in the simplest (and probably most accurate) way, it just gives you 10 hashes. I will enter into detail later.

<h3> What should I use Hasher for? </h2>
Hasher can be used for almost anything, so I will list examples of what Hasher does and doesn't.
<ul>
<li> Hasher <b>is</b>: </li>
	<li> A random value generator </li>
	<li> A sha256/sha512/sha1/md5 system test </li>
	<li> A roleplaying tool </li>
<li> Hasher <b>isn't</b>: </li>
	<li> A password generator </li>
	<li> A ransomware decryptor </li>
	<li> A cryptocurrency miner </li>
</ul>
<h2> How does Hasher work? </h2>
Hasher takes 10 random numbers from <i>0</i> to <i>999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999</i>, and then encodes them to a string that Python's "hashlib" can understand. Hasher then takes the hash, re-encodes it, and passes it through another equal algorithm.

<h3> What algorithms can I use? </h3>
For the moment, we've got 4 algorithms! Type:
<ul>
<li> "md5" for MD5 </li>
<li> "sha1" for, well, SHA1 </li>
<li> "sha256" for SHA256 </li>
<li> "sha512" for, you guessed it, SHA512. </li>
<ul>

<h2> What can I do with Hasher's source code? </h2>
Hasher uses the GNU-GPLv3 license, which essentially means that you can do anything with my code except making it closed-source.
